Patches for WIEN2k 17.1
-----------------------

- Place hmsec.patch into $WIENROOT/SRC_lapwso
- Apply the patch with: patch -b hmsec.F hmsec.patch
Description: This patch and -Dold_scalapack need to be added to FPOPT if an ifort version older than composer xe 2013 update 2 is used. However, there are cases where the Scalapack diagonalization of these older compilers can fail. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use a newer ifort compiler version, which has a pzheevr function that eliminates that issue.
